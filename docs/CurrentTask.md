# CurrentTask.md — CJelly Work Tracker

This document is the single source of truth for what we’re doing now and what’s next. It’s organized in three levels so we can guide the immediate work while keeping the roadmap visible.

## Level 1 — High-level Overview (Engine/Window split v0.1)
- **Goal**: Stand-alone GUI library with clean Engine (device/resources/jobs/assets) vs Window (OS surface/swapchain/input) separation.
- **State**: Headers migrated; engine/window skeletons in place; demo uses new API; most legacy globals removed.
- **Outcome**: All apps use public `cj_*.h` C-first API with opaque handles; platform details hidden; per-window rendering via render graph.

## Level 2 — Mid-level Roadmap (actionable tracks)
1) Engine/Window split hardening
   - Eliminate legacy drawing paths in `src/cjelly.c` and move per-window recording to `src/window.c`.
   - Remove any remaining reads/writes of legacy globals.

2) Cleanup/teardown correctness (validation clean)
   - Destroy per-window resources and app-owned resources before device/context.
   - Ensure pipelines, layouts, buffers, descriptor pools/sets, images, image views, and memory are fully released.

3) Public API finalization (C-first, handles)
   - Switch resources to 64-bit opaque handles `(index:32 | generation:32)`.
   - Centralize bindless descriptor arrays in the Engine.

4) Resource managers
   - Implement alloc/free and lifetime tracking for buffers/images/samplers/pipelines.
   - Remove ad-hoc globals and scattered ownership.

5) Render graph
   - Implement `cj_rgraph_t` and `cj_window_set_render_graph`.
   - Windows render via the graph, not direct helper functions.

6) Platform separation
   - Move Xlib/Win32 specifics into platform modules per `cj_platform.h`.
   - Window owns OS surface + swapchain only.

7) Diagnostics/logging
   - Gate debug prints (env/build flag); quiet by default.
   - Trim validation layer spam in release.

8) Shader hot-reload
   - File watch → recompile → swap pipeline, plumbed through Engine.

9) Headers/Docs
   - Public headers finalized (`include/cjelly/cj_*.h`); document API.
   - Remove any stale legacy references.

10) Test/demo app hygiene
   - Use only public headers (`cjelly.h`, `cj_*`, `runtime.h`).
   - Avoid `engine_internal.h`/OS globals; destroy app resources before context.

## Level 3 — Detailed current task (execution checklist)
Focus: 2) Cleanup/teardown correctness (validation clean)
1. Audit live objects on shutdown (pipelines, layouts, buffers, descriptor pools/sets, images, image views, memory).
2. Ensure `cj_window_destroy` frees swapchain-dependent resources and command buffers before device idle.
3. Ensure app-dynamic resources (e.g., color-only bindless) are destroyed before `cjelly_destroy_context`.
4. Verify queues idle (`vkDeviceWaitIdle`) before tearing down per-window resources.
5. Re-run with validation; iterate until no leaks are reported.

# CurrentTask.md - CJelly Library Development Plan

## Current State Analysis

### What's Been Built (POC Stage)
- **Basic Vulkan Framework**: Multi-window support with platform abstraction (Win32/X11)
- **Application API**: High-level Vulkan initialization with configurable constraints
- **Simple Rendering**: Two-window demo with basic colored squares and textured squares
- **Platform Abstraction**: Cross-platform window creation and event handling
- **Image Format Support**: Basic BMP loading and texture rendering
- **Bindless Rendering Infrastructure**: Complete texture atlas system and bindless shader pipeline
- **Descriptor Indexing Support**: Extension detection and fallback mechanisms

### Current Architecture Issues
1. **Verbose and Repetitive Code**: The current implementation has significant code duplication
2. **Global State Management**: Heavy reliance on global variables makes the code hard to maintain
3. **Mixed Concerns**: Platform code, Vulkan setup, and rendering logic are intertwined
4. **Limited Abstraction**: Direct Vulkan calls throughout the codebase
5. **Hardware Compatibility**: Descriptor indexing extension not available on all target hardware
